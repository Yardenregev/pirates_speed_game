# Pirates Speed Game

## Game Rules
The players split into commander and captain,
the commander manages the game and the captain plays the game.

Each captain has a hand of pirate scum, that he wishes to rid the ship of.

The commander shouts a command to all the captains, and the captains each look 
for a pirate that can perform the command and send the pirate to the commander.
The first captain to send a pirate that is able to perform the command is able to
get rid of the pirate.

The winning captain is the first captain to have no pirates on the ship.

## Game Play
The game is played by minimum of two players, the commander and the captain.
